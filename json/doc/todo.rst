* Implement Variant parser
* Cleanup ItemParser to be a little more useful

* Add parser statistics output:

    1. How many of each type of json thing were parsed (object, list, int, etc)
    2. Bytes required to copy out all of the parsed strings.

* Use a fixed stack size for parse stack?
* Move builder stuff into variant header/cc
